For this project, we were instructed to create a Weather Dashboard.
I used the open weather API. Using this API caused some challenges that were overcome by targeting the objects correctly and converting the Kelvin temperature units to Fahrenheit. When you type in the city you are given current weather information for the day and also a 5-day forecast for the next 5 days. When looking at the UV index you will get the color based on the number value of the UV index. I saved the typed city to local storage so the customer can see what was chosen beforehand.
